# Matplot-Challenge
**Scenario:** You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

**Analysis:** 
**1. Outlier Identification:** Outlined circles effectively highlight extreme data points, aiding outlier identification within the dataset.
**2. Visual Emphasis:** Contrasting colors draw attention to outliers, making them visually prominent within the boxplot.
**3. Data Distribution Insights:** The boxplot provides a concise summary of the dataset's distribution, including key statistical measures such as the median, quartiles, and range.
**4. Regression Line Interpretation:** The linear regression line provides a visual representation of the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume. Its slope indicates the rate of change in tumor volume per unit change in weight, while the intercept represents the estimated tumor volume when weight is zero.
**5. The correlation coefficient** between mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.84, indicating a strong positive correlation between these two variables. This suggests that as mouse weight increases, the average tumor volume tends to increase as well.
